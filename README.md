URL shortener app made with Django, a Python framework for building awesome web pages.
The project folder is called config. However, in one tutorial, I used Shorty. if I
change the name to Shorty, the project will break.

But everything remains the same.

This app is not deployed. In a future Django project, I will deploy that one.
